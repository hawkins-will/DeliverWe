# DeliverWe


##What is DeliverWe?
DeliverWe is a Web Application designed to help with groups of people ordering food.

Imagine you're sitting in your office before lunch wondering what you want to eat. Hop onto DeliverWe to check out what other people in your building are ordering and see if you want to join anyone's order. If nothing anyone's getting sounds good, start your own order and invite other people to join you. This way, you can meet delivery minimums easily and split and fees and tip that your order includes.

DeliverWe will show you the cost for each individual person's portion of the order. You'll never have to argue about who owes what again; DeliverWe will do the work for you and help preserve your friendships!

Of note, DeliverWe does not currently place orders for you. It serves as an organizational tool to help one person place the order and get reimbursed by everyone.
